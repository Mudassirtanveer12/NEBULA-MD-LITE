 * ========================================================================
 * !!!!!! FINAL WARNING TO ANYONE ATTEMPTING TO DECRYPT NEBULA MD  !!!!!!
 * ========================================================================
 * 
 * ATTENTION: This message is directed specifically to anyone who has obtained
 * a copy of my MD bot, "Nebula MD ," and is attempting to reverse engineer,
 * decrypt, decompile, or otherwise tamper with its code.
 * 
 * I am Ridz Coder. This is my creation, my work, and my property.
 * 
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SECTION 1: YOU ARE PLAYING WITH FIRE
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * You think this is just some simple script you can tear apart? You believe
 * you can bypass my protections and steal my work? You are dangerously mistaken.
 * 
 * Nebula MD  is not a toy. It is protected by multiple layers of security
 * that you cannot possibly comprehend:
 * 
 * - **Encrypted Core:** The main functionality is locked behind military-grade
 *   encryption that would take a supercomputer decades to crack
 * - **Anti-Tamper Systems:** The moment you try to decompile this, hidden
 *   routines activate and permanently corrupt the codebase
 * - **Digital Fingerprinting:** Your every attempt is being logged, including
 *   your system information, IP address, and exactly what you're trying to do
 * - **Call Home Protocols:** Multiple silent beacons are reporting your
 *   activities back to my secure servers in real-time
 * 
 * I know who you are. I know what you're doing. And I know where to find you.
 * 
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SECTION 2: THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR CURIOSITY
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * Let me be perfectly clear about what will happen if you continue:
 * 
 * 1. **IMMEDIATE RETALIATION:** The moment I confirm your tampering attempts,
 *    countermeasures will be deployed. This isn't a threat - it's a promise.
 * 
 * 2. **DIGITAL OBRATION:** Your access to Nebula MD  will be
 *    permanently revoked. All your associated accounts will be blacklisted
 *    from my systems forever.
 * 
 * 3. **NETWORK EXPOSURE:** Your attempts and identity will be shared across
 *    my network of developers and security researchers. You will be marked
 *    as untrustworthy throughout the community.
 * 
 * 4. **LEGAL ACTION:** I maintain extensive logs of all access attempts.
 *    These logs are admissible evidence, and I will not hesitate to pursue
 *    maximum legal penalties for copyright infringement and unauthorized
 *    access.
 * 
 * 5. **PERSONAL CONSEQUENCES:** This is not an anonymous game. I have the
 *    capability to trace your activities back to your real identity, your
 *    location, and your digital footprint. The revenge will be precise,
 *    targeted, and devastating to your online presence.
 * 
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SECTION 3: THIS IS YOUR ONLY WARNING
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * I don't make empty threats. I don't bluff. My reputation is built on
 * following through on my warnings.
 * 
 * If you value your:
 * - Online accounts
 * - Digital identity  
 * - Access to my future projects
 * - Your peace of mind
 * 
 * You will CEASE all attempts to decrypt Nebula MD  IMMEDIATELY.
 * 
 * Close your decompilers. Stop your debugging sessions. Delete any copies
 * you have obtained illegally. Walk away now, and I may consider this
 * matter closed.
 * 
 * Continue, and you will learn exactly why the name "Ridz Coder" is
 * respected - and feared - in these circles.
 * 
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SECTION 4: THE BETTER PATH FORWARD
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * If you're genuinely interested in MD bot technology, there are proper
 * channels:
 * 
 * - Study legitimate programming resources
 * - Learn JavaScript and Discord.js properly
 * - Build your own tools from scratch
 * - Contact me through official channels for collaboration opportunities
 * 
 * Stealing my work is the path of a coward. Building your own is the path
 * of a true developer.
 * 
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FINAL MESSAGE
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * This is not a game. This is not a challenge. This is your final warning.
 * 
 * I am watching. I am logging. I am waiting.
 * 
 * Cross this line, and you will face consequences you cannot imagine.
 * 
 * - Ridz Coder
 * Creator of Nebula MD

 * ========================================================================
 * END OF WARNING - HEED THIS MESSAGE
